# So You Want to Be an Organizer?

Hosting a tournament is the best way to build a local Beyblade community. But if you've never done it before, it can feel overwhelming.

Don't worry—we've got you covered. Here is your step-by-step checklist.

## 1. Secure a Venue

You don't need a convention center. Most grassroots tournaments start in:
*   **Local Game Stores (LGS)**: Ask if you can use their tables on a slow night (Tuesday/Wednesday).
*   **Public Parks**: Great for summer, but wind can be an issue for stadiums.
*   **Community Centers**: Often rent rooms for cheap.

> **Tip:** Always bring **folding tables**. You never know if the venue will have enough space for 8-10 stadiums.

## 2. Gather Equipment

For a 16-player tournament, you ideally need:
*   **4 Stadiums** (1 per 4 players).
*   **Stopwatches** (phones work fine).
*   **Backup Parts** (bits/ratchets) for new players.

## 3. The Ruleset

At the moment, BeyBracket supports one primary format designed for competitive play:

*   **Swiss -> Elimination**: All players compete in Swiss rounds (no eliminations), and the Top 8 move to a Single Elimination bracket.
*   **Scoring**: Matches are played to **4 Points** during the Swiss stage.
*   **Finals**: The Grand Finals are played to **7 Points** for that championship intensity.
*   **Deck Format vs. 3on3**: Decide if players bring 3 fixed beys or a deck they can switch from.

## 4. Using BeyBracket

This is the easy part.
1.  **Create an Account** and switch to "Organizer Mode".
2.  **Create Tournament**: Set the name, location, and date.
3.  **Check-in Players**: Share the link or QR code so players can join from their phones.
4.  **Start Tournament**: BeyBracket handles all the pairings.
5.  **Enter Scores**: You (or the players) can report scores directly.

## 5. Prizes

You don't need big cash prizes.
*   **Beyblades**: A rare booster or a new starter is always hype.
*   **Trophies**: 3D printed trophies are cheap and beloved.
*   **Store Credit**: If hosting at a shop, this helps the venue too!
