# Why Swiss?

In the world of fast-paced spinning top battles, **elimination** is cruel. You travel an hour to a venue, lose one game, and you're out.

Enter the **Swiss System**.

The Swiss format is designed to find a clear winner without eliminating anyone early. It guarantees that every Blader gets to play multiple matches (usually 4-6 rounds), regardless of whether they win or lose.

## How it Works

1.  **Round 1**: Pairings are random.
2.  **Round 2**: 1-0 players play other 1-0 players. 0-1 players play other 0-1 players.
3.  **Subsequent Rounds**: You always play someone with the same (or very similar) win-loss record as you.

This means as the tournament goes on, matches get closer and fairer. By Round 4, the undefeated players are battling for the top seed, while everyone else fights for a spot in the Top Cut.

> **Pro Tip:** In a 32-player tournament, you usually need at least **3 wins** to have a chance at making the Top 8 (Top Cut).

## Scoring in Beyblade X

BeyBracket supports the official WBO and Hasbro match scoring:

| Finish Type | Points | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spin Finish** | 1 Point | One Beyblade outspins the other. |
| **Over Finish** | 2 Points | A Beyblade is knocked into the Over Zone (pocket). |
| **Burst Finish** | 2 Points | A Beyblade bursts into parts. |
| **Xtreme Finish** | 3 Points | A Beyblade is knocked into the Xtreme Zone (center exit). |

Matches are played to **7 Points** (in standard WBO rules) or **4 Points** (in some local formats).

## The Top Cut

After the Swiss rounds end, the top players (usually Top 8 or Top 16) move on to a Single Elimination Bracket. This is where the tension peaks—one loss, and it's game over!

## Why use BeyBracket?

Running a Swiss tournament on paper is a nightmare. Calculating **Buchholz Scores** (tie-breakers) by hand? Forget it.

**BeyBracket** automates everything:
*   Generates fair pairings instantly.
*   Calculates resistance/tie-breakers automatically.
*   Handles "Drop" players seamlessly.
