# The Xtreme System

Beyblade X introduces a game-changer: **The X Line**. This rail gear accelerates tops to intense speeds, leading to explosive finishes.

But with new mechanics come new scoring rules. Here is how it breaks down.

| Finish Type | Points | Visual Cue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spin Finish** | **1 Point** | The opponent stops spinning while you are still moving. |
| **Over Finish** | **2 Points** | The opponent is knocked into one of the corner pockets (Over Zones). |
| **Burst Finish** | **2 Points** | The opponent's Beyblade bursts into its component parts (Blade, Ratchet, Bit). |
| **Xtreme Finish** | **3 Points** | The opponent is knocked into the large center Xtreme Zone (usually via the X Line). |

## Match Length

*   **WBO Ranked**: First to **7 Points**.
*   **WBO Unranked / Club**: Often first to **5 Points**.
*   **Hasbro**: Often first to **4 Points**.

> **Note:** Drawings (both Beys stop / exit at the exact same time) result in **no points** and the round is replayed.

## Why 7 Points?

In previous generations, matches were to 3 points. But because the **Xtreme Finish** grants 3 points instantly, a match could end in one hit!

Raising the limit to 7 points ensures that skill and consistency matter more than a single lucky shot. It allows for comebacks—an Xtreme Finish can turn a 0-4 loser into a close contender instantly.

## Keeping Track

In a high-pressure tournament, it's easy to forget if the score is 3-2 or 4-2.

**BeyBracket** handles this for you. Just click the finish type (Spin, Over, Burst, Xtreme) and we update the score automatically. No math required!
